## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. It includes areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of AI that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The main types are:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

### Deep Learning

Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex abstractions in data. It is especially effective for:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Machine translation
- Content generation

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include:

- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Text generation

### Transformers

Transformers revolutionized NLP through the attention mechanism. Famous models include:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines information retrieval with text generation. The process:

1. **Indexing**: Documents are converted to embeddings and stored
2. **Retrieval**: Search for relevant documents for a query
3. **Generation**: LLM generates response based on retrieved context

### Advantages of RAG
- Responses based on updated information
- Reduction of model hallucinations
- Traceability of information sources
- Lower cost than fine-tuning

### ChromaDB

ChromaDB is an open-source vector database optimized for:
- Efficient storage of embeddings
- Semantic similarity search
- Integration with LangChain and other frameworks
- Local data persistence

## Embeddings

Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
Popular models include:
- Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- BERT embeddings

An embedding converts words or phrases into numerical vectors where similar texts are close in the vector space.
- Source traceability
- No need to retrain the model

### RAG Components
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate
- **Embeddings**: Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI
- **LLM**: GPT, Llama, Claude
- **Framework**: LangChain, LlamaIndex
